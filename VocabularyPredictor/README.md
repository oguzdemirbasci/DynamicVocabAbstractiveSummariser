# Dynamic Vocabulary Predictor
This repository provides PyTorch implementations of the method named NLG-RL proposed by Hashimoto et al. [1] for reinforcement learning for sentence generation with action-space reduction. The vocabulary predictor in version 0.2 of their work is used in this project.

## Requirements
* Python 3.X
* PyTorch 0.2X or 0.4X
* Numba
